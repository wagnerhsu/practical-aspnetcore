# MVC (43)

This section contains all micro samples for **ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1**.

Pre-requisite: Make sure you download .NET Core SDK 2.1 (`2.1.0`) otherwise below examples won't work.

There is no more need to include this tool in your project `<DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools" Version="2.1.0-preview1" />` to be able to enjoy `dotnet watch run`. It's included by default in ASP.NET Core 2.1.

* [Hello World Minimalistic](/projects/mvc/hello-world)
  This is the most basic hello world you can do using ASP.NET MVC. It uses `services.AddMvcCore()` with [behavior compatibility](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/02/27/introducing-compatibility-version-in-mvc/) set to `2.1` and with manually configured route.

  You shouldn't use this configuration for your typical ASP.NET MVC Core application (it does not support Razor, etc). This is just an example on how to do it with the least amount of functionality and configuration. You can find a discussion about `services.AddMvcCore()` [here](https://offering.solutions/blog/articles/2017/02/07/difference-between-addmvc-addmvcore/).


## Authentication/Authorization

* [JWT](/projects/mvc/jwt)

  Show how to generate and decode [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/).

## API

* [Use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProblemDetails](/projects/mvc/api-problem-details)

  Use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProblemDetails` as part of your Web API error reply. It is implementing [RFC  7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807). It will make life easier for everybody.

* [Extends Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProblemDetails](/projects/mvc/api-problem-details-2)

  Extend `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProblemDetails` to make it easier for day to day use. It will adjust what kind of information it shows based on your development environment.

## Model Binding
  
  We are exploring everything related to model binding in this section.

  * [Model binding using a class and FromQuery attribute](/projects/mvc/model-binding-from-query)

    Use `[FromQuery]` attribute to have MVC put all the query string values nicely in a class instead of using primitives e.g. `int userId`.

  * [Model binding using a class and FromRoute attribute](/projects/mvc/model-binding-from-route)

    Use `[FromRoute]` attribute to have MVC put all the route values nicely in a class instead of using primitives e.g. `int userId`.


## Formatters

* [Using Utf8Json as JSON Formatter](/projects/mvc/utf8json-formatter)

  Use the super fast [Ut8Json](https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json) JSON serialization library instead of the default one. This project requires `utf8json` and `Utf8Json.AspNetCoreMvcFormatter` packages.

* [Returning XML Response](/projects/mvc/mvc-output-xml)

  Return XML response using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Xml`. 

## Swagger (API Documentation)

* [Using NSwag](/projects/mvc/nswag)
  
  Generate automatic documentation for your Web API using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) specification and [NSwag](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag)

  You can further learn on how to customize the output of your documentation [here](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore#include-descriptions-from-xml-comments) and [here](http://michaco.net/blog/TipsForUsingSwaggerAndAutorestInAspNetCoreMvcServices).

  Do not forget to enable XML documentation XML generation for your project

  ``` xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

  We also use the new `ActionResult<T>` return type. You can read more about the type [here](https://joonasw.net/view/aspnet-core-2-1-actionresult-of-t).

* [Customizing NSwag](/projects/mvc/nswag-2)

  Use attribute such as `SwaggerTag` to organize your API or `SwaggerIgnore` to hide an API from the definition (using `[ApiExplorerSettings(IgnoreApi = true)]` also works).

## Tag Helpers

  * [Tag Helper - Hello World](/projects/mvc/tag-helper)

    This is the simplest tag helper you can do. It just prints 'hello world'.

  * [Tag Helper - Alert Tag Helper](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-2)

    Convert a message to become an alert message (bootstrap 4).

  * [Tag Helper - Alert Tag Helper With Style](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-3)

    Convert a message to become an alert message with 4 style of alerts (bootstrap 4).

  * [Tag Helper - Alert Tag Helper with other enclosed Tag Helpers](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-4)

    Demonstrate the usage of other tag helpers within the enclosure of an Alert Tag Helper.
    
  * [Tag Helper - Nested Alert Tag Helper](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-5)

    Demonstrate passing values from Parent Tag to Child Tag.


## Tag Helpers Tips and Tricks

  * [Cache Busting Tag Helper](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-link)

    Use `asp-append-version` to your css and script link to make sure that your visitors always use the latest version of your style and script files.

  * [Cache Busting Image Tag Helper](/projects/mvc/tag-helper-img)

    Use `asp-append-version` to your images to make sure that your visitors always use the latest version of images.


## MVC and Pages Routing

  We are exploring every single boring details about MVC and Pages routing in this section.

  * [MVC Routing - 1](/projects/mvc/routing-1)

    Demonstrates fixed routing and default conventional routing for ASP.NET MVC.
  
  * [MVC Routing - 2](/projects/mvc/routing-2)

    Similar to `Routing - 1` but using alternative method to specify default conventional routing.

  * [MVC Routing - 3](/projects/mvc/routing-3)

    Use `UseMvcWithDefaultRoute` so you don't have to define the default conventional route. This is how the extension is [implemented](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/e2de54a92d8254a27f9eefd77e08370c7b17fa5d/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/Builder/MvcApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs).

    ``` csharp
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseMvcWithDefaultRoute(this IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        if (app == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(app));
        }

        return app.UseMvc(routes =>
        {
            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "default",
                template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
    ```

  * [MVC Routing - 4](/projects/mvc/routing-4)

    The simplest example for attribute routing. We use the `Route` attribute at the Controller. This only allows you to have one Action per Controller.

  * [MVC Routing - 5](/projects/mvc/routing-5)

    We use the `Route` attribute at Action methods (in contrast to previous example). This allows you to have multiple Actions in a Controller.

  * [MVC Routing - 6](/projects/mvc/routing-6)

    Demonstrate the usage of `HttpGet` and `HttpPost`.

  * [MVC Routing - 7](/projects/mvc/routing-7)

    Demonstrate the usage of `[controller]` replacement token at the `Route` attribute.
  
  * [MVC Routing - 8](/projects/mvc/routing-8)

    Demonstrate the usage of `[controller]` and `[action]` replacement tokens at the `Route` attribute.

  * [MVC Routing - 9](/projects/mvc/routing-9)

    Demonstrate the usage of `[action]` replacement tokens at the `HttpGet` attribute.

  * [MVC Routing - 10](/projects/mvc/routing-10)

    Demonstrate the usage of `IActionConstraint` attribute.

    The following map routing will search all HomeController.About action accross the assembly regardless of namespace. If you have multiple
    HomeController.About, it will generate error because the framework cannot decide which method to use. This sample demonstrates on how using
    a custom `IActionConstraint` attribute solves this problem.

    ``` csharp
    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
        "About",
        "{id}/About",
        defaults: new { controller = "Home", Action = "About" });
    });
    ```

  * [Routing Table](/projects/mvc/routing-table)

    Use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.IActionDescriptorCollectionProvider` to interrogate the routing table to display all the registered routes in the system, whether it is using conventional routing or attribute routing.

## Localization (7)

  We are exploring all the nitty gritty of localization with MVC here.

  * [MVC Localization](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization)

    Demonstrate the sample of naming resource file using the "." dot naming convention. In this case, our Assembly Name differs from our namespace so we use full type name in our resource. This allows `IStringLocalizer<>` to be used in Controllers.

  * [MVC Localization - 2](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-2)

    This sample is identical as previous example except that we are using the path naming convention. 
    
  * [MVC Localization - 3](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-3)

    Demonstrate an easy way to use shared resources. The class name, `Global`, is just a name. It can be `Common` or `CommonResources`, etc. It does not matter.

  * [MVC Localization - 4](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-4)

    Similar to `MVC Localization - 3` except that now the assembly name and namespace share the same name. This is in contrast to `MVC Localization - 1` and `MVC Localization`.

  * [MVC Localization - 5](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-5)

    Use shared resource on View.

  * [MVC Localization - 6](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-6)

    If you keep wondering why your default request language doesn't work, this example is for you.
    
    This example demonstrates on how to ignore browser language preference by removing `AcceptLanguageHeaderRequestCultureProvider` and forcing your default language. This [article](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2017/06/22/request-culture-asp-net-core/) has a useful explanation on this provider.

  * [MVC Localization - 7](/projects/mvc/mvc-localization-7)

    This sample shows how to use localization resources located in a separate project. Notice how the namespace correspondents to the folder name at the resource project.

## View Component (4)

  We are exploring everything about ViewComponent in this section.

  * [ View Component - Hello world](/projects/mvc/view-component)

    This is the simplest sample of a `ViewComponent` that accept parameters. As you can see, the file for the `ViewComponent` class can be located anywhere. 

    From the [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-2.2#view-search-path) 
    
    > The runtime searches for the view in the following paths:

    > * /Pages/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
    > * /Views/{Controller Name}/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
    > * /Views/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
    
    > We recommend you name the view file Default.cshtml... 

    So you will find the code for this `HelloWorldViewComponent` at `/Views/Shared/Components/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cs` and the view at `/Views/Shared/Components/HelloWorld/Default.cshtml`.
    

  * [ View Component - Alternative Declaration](/projects/mvc/view-component-2)

    This sample is the same as previous sample except the use of Tag Helper invocation. Use `@addTagHelper *, <AssemblyName>` to enable the invocation of view component as a Tag Helper. Pascal-cased view component class and properties are translated into their lower kebab case. 

  * [ View Component - Return View Component result directly from a controller](/projects/mvc/view-component-3)

    This sample shows how to return the output of a View Component directly from a controller. Don't forget that your `_Layout.cshtml` won't be used here. It will just return whatever your View Component is producing.

  * [ View Component - Passing complex object as parameter](/projects/mvc/view-component-4)

    This sample shows you how to pass complex object to the View Component.

## Razor Class Library (3)

  We are exploring Razor Class Library (RCL) functionalities in this section. RCL allows you to create reusable UI libraries.

  * [Razor Class Library - Hello World](/projects/mvc/razor-class-library)

    This is the simplest example to demonstrate the functionality of RCL. The library uses Razor Pages. Go to `src/WebApplication` folder and run `dotnet watch run` to run the sample.

    Thanks to [@AdrienTorris](https://twitter.com/AdrienTorris).
 
  * [Razor Class Library - Include static files](/projects/mvc/razor-class-library-with-static-files)

    This is similar to previous example except now you can including static files (javascript, images, css, etc) with your RCL. Go to `src/WebApplication` folder and run `dotnet watch run` to run the sample.
    
    Thanks to [@AdrienTorris](https://twitter.com/AdrienTorris).

  * [Razor Class Library - using Controllers and Views](/projects/mvc/razor-class-library-with-controllers)

    This sample demonstrates on how to use Controllers and Views in your Razor Class Library in contrast to previous examples that uses Razor Pages.

    
    Thanks to [@AdrienTorris](https://twitter.com/AdrienTorris).

## Syndication Output Formatter (1)

  We are building a RSS/ATOM Output formatter starting from the very basic.

  * [Output Formatter Syndication](/projects/mvc/output-formatter-syndication)

    This is a very rudimentary RSS output formatter. It's valid but it does not do much other than providing RSS items.
